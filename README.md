 Hello! Welcome to Street2Feast! We’re a group of four college students, with group name Flavor Explorers, brought together by our love for Chinese food and the deep influence of Chinese culture in our everyday lives.

Together we created a website about different cities of China and their special local food. The aim is for a site that is for Chinese culture or food lovers, or visitors to explore and transport them to different Chinese cultures and discover cuisines from different cities in China. 

This website will feature 7 html pages in total, including "Home (index.html)", "Destinations", "Cusine Guide", "About Us", and 3 Chinese cities ("Shanghai", "Beijing", "Chengdu"), cities page are embeded in the "Destination" tabe while exploring the website.

We utilized Bootstrap as our global style sheet and a custom navigation bar throughout the whole website, for users to explore the website more efficiently (Two main ways to explore the site: 1. explores "Destinations", cities in China 2. search for Chinese cuisiines in "Cusine Guide").
